Demonstrates the usage of DynamicDialog from the ivyAddOns project. 

Dialogs of this type can be used to dynamically display input/edit masks for business objects. Their appearance can be configured according to a static configuration that is stored in the CMS (a so-called CmsContext). 

The demo allows you to start two DynamicDialog instances for the same SimpleContact business object, but with two different CmsContext configurations.
