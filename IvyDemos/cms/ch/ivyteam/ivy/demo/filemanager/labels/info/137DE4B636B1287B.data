<B>Important informations:</B>
<BR><BR>

The FileManager is configured with a FileManagerConfigurationController object.<BR>
This object stores all the settings needed for the FileManager. The configuration controller allows fine tuning the FileManager's options. <BR>
<BR>
The external Ivy database configuration is already prepared in the demo project: it's name is "filemanager". You have to adapt this configuration to your external database settings.<BR>
Here you don't have the possibility to set all the possible options dynamically. <BR>
You are of course free to set these parameters directly in the configuration controller object in your own implementations. Please refer to the FileManager IvyAddons documentation.
