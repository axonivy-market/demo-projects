# Connectivity Demo
Axon Ivy's Connectivity (REST/SOAP) Demo nicely showcases using standard architecture principles to create interactive
applications with web services.

The solution:
 
- illustrates how to access your own REST service
- contains an example of a business process that is called via a REST service
- shows asynchronous services via REST (own chat implementation)
- shows how easy data mapping using REST works
- illustrates the uploading of data via REST
- demonstrates REST in combination with OpenAPI and OData
- gives many examples of how to use SOAP service within the platform
