v2.25.0
=======
WebDriver:
  * Added API for dealing with BASIC and DIGEST authentication
    dialogs. Currently not implemented in any drivers.
  * Warn users that the IE driver will no longer use the DLL in the
    next release.
  * Deprecated browser specific WebElement subclasses.
  * Added support for "requiredCapabilities" to the remote webdrivers
    and implemented basic support for these in the firefox
    driver. Failure to fulfull a required capability will cause a
    SessionNotCreatedException to be thrown.
  * Added the ability to determine how unhandled alerts should be
    handled. This is handled by the "unexpectedAlertBehaviour"
    capability, which can be one of "accept", "dismiss" or
    "ignore". Java code should use the UnexpectedAlertBehaviour
    enum. This is only implemented in Firefox for now.
  * Allow native events to be configured in Firefox and
    (experimentally) in IE using the "nativeEvents" capability.
  * Updated supported versions of Firefox to 17.
  * Firefox driver will enumerate through client rects until finding
    one with non-zero dimensions when clicking.

    visibility.

    file:// URL.

  * Avoid an issue where a call to submit could hang the firefox
    driver.

    RuntimeExceptions.

=======

Project:
  * Code grant from Google acknowledged in our copyright
    headers. Thanks, Google!

WebDriver:
  * JRE dependency upped to Java 6.
  * IE driver now uses the IEDriverServer. You may need to download
    this. Set the "useLegacyInternalServer" to boolean true if you
    need the old behaviour.
  * Standardized colour values returned from getCssValue are
    normalized to RGBA.

    differentiate between browser hang and client gone (which is
    -timeout <timeout>)
    - System property -Dselenium.server.timeout removed, use -timeout instead.
    See http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RemoteWebDriverServer 
    for further details.
    * Issue 3577

Maven:

  * NOTE: We have removed our dependency on the operadriver from our
    pom, because it creates a circular dependency.  To use the
    operadriver, add the following dependency to your own pom.xml
    file:

    instead of trying to explicitly trigger it at the appropriate
    times. This makes debugging much simpler.
  * WebDriverJS hub front-end now renders correctly in IE.

Grid:
  * It's now a beautiful butterfly.

RC:
  * IE HTA mode will now close the final window.
